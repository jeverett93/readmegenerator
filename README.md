# About: 
This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The application can be invoked with the following command:

```sh
node index.js
```

The user will be prompted for their GitHub username, which will be used to make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. They will then be prompted with questions about their project.
